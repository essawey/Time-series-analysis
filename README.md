# Time-series-analysis

## Problem Definition
The world is currently going through many crises, especially in Egypt, after the multiple devaluations of the Egyptian pound in the last couple of years, dropping 14.5% against the USD on the 27th of October 2022 (Werr, 2022); thus, the need for finding a reliable investment is increasing over time. We had been using the time series analysis to help us predict the socket market price of the Commercial International Bank CIB localized in Egypt. Adding on, we have been pulling the closing price of the CIB from Yahoo finance for the past five years. Moreover, we are predicting the price from June to December 2022. To advise people to invest in CIB stocks. We are evaluating our prediction based on the difference between the testing data observed and predicted prices, which is appropriately six-month starting from the 1st of June and ending by the 1st of December of 2022.
